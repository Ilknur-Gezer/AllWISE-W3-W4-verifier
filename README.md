# AllWISE-W3-W4-verifier
This repository contains a machine learning-based framework to assess the reliability of WISE W3 and W4 detections for young stellar objects (YSOs) using AllWISE catalogue parameters. We trained and evaluated multiple classifiers—including Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Decision Tree—on labeled cutout data from the Orion region. The final model selection is based on cross-validated accuracy, with Random Forest consistently performing best.
